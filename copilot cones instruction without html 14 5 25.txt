Rainbow shades and hues which change and expand as the number of cones and other shapes increases.
lighting to make 3d cones and text look the most plastic. glossy and shiny.

Number of cones, cubes,cyclinders

a space between objects called Increments such that when increments increase in value the objects move apart 
for example there are 3 cones if the increment is 2units then all cones are 2 units apart but when a cone is 30 units in diameter the increment need to then make all cone spread out evenly so that no cones overlap.

There is an increments function menu for height, radius 
length and width.


height,length,width controls for unit by number increments
orientation control by mouse and shift key

a menu which can be hidden and un hidden


Stable cone sizing with linear progression

Enhanced lighting system with shadows

Improved material properties for better visual quality

Isolated color changes for selected cone

Corrected color control functionality

Smoother camera animations

Better grid visibility

Enhanced UI contrast and styling

Proper error handling

Optimized performance

All cones now maintain proportional sizing without sudden jumps

Added ambient and directional lighting for better material rendering

Enhanced visual feedback for selected cone with stronger emissive glow

Fixed color controls to properly update non-selected cones

Improved camera motion smoothness

Increased grid visibility for better spatial reference

Adjusted material properties for more metallic, reflective appearance

These changes result in:

Stable cone sizes with smooth progression

Enhanced visual hierarchy and depth

Clearer selection feedback

More intuitive color controls

Overall more polished and professional appearance
